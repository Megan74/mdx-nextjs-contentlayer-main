I have always thought that being a web developer, was all about the building and the architectural part of developping a web application, with a collaborative team. As a matter of fact, I was partly wrong. 

Debugging is as important as programming and designging the project provided. 

Troubleshooting broken code for hours even days sometimes, made me realize how **organized**, thorough, attentive, you have to be, to become a excellent software engineer.

Modern frameworks, dependencies and new packages are daily created to improve the company online productivity. The technology evolving as light speed, forces software developments to upgrade and adjust quickly its packages, and will unavoidably cause disruptions with its newest versions.

Among the different type of bugs, the main ones are named **software regressions** :

 - Local bug : a code change that causes a new dysfunction in the modified module or component.
 - Remote bug : a change in one part of the software breaks functionality in another module or component. example: a missing semi-colon can paralyze a whole CSS file
 - Unmasked bug : a code change notifiying an already existing bug that had no effect before the change.

Indeed, development projects are getting bigger with these newer functionalities and features installed, so more likely to face bugs and blocks along the way, as incompatibility issues for example.

Conclusion : Developers have to logically structure applications in a secure way.

## Patterns Paradigms Set of rules

Debugging is a way to learn and a way to re organise effectively its project, so the codebase stays maintanable in the long run. 

Along the way, strategies have to be incorporated, to debug more easily when you face these blocks and secure the codebase until its online deployment.

My MVC lecture <a href="/articles/post-7">post </a> , is actually an efficient example on how to standardize the codebase with a strong configuration, 
that will avoid any dysfunctions during the different building phases.

That architecture pattern, split the code into different modules, in order to identify quickly which roles and repsonsibilities each of these 
code possesses. By identifying and categorize the codebase into different modules, troubleshooting bugs are getting easier and quicker.

And even after adding or modifying features into the application, the Model View Controller pattern will provide an enhanced protection of the code for the team that is building it.

The three modules : 

-Model : data architecture 
- View : graphic user interface 
- Controller : interaction functionality between the view and the model,

 are specifically designed to update each one of these sextions without fearing of breaking the other parts of the application.
