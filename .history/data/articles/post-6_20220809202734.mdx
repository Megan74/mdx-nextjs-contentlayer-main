## Yelpcamp app

I am currently building a camping sites suggestion app, for nature lovers.
 That heartfelt project contains a Mern stack, that integrates frontend and backend modules, plus bootstrap library for the designing features.
The user will be able to chose among the best north American campsites, based upond the prices and locations. 
Thanks to the backend server integration via express middleware and its crud functionalities, the user has also the possibility to update the campgrounds list, 
delete it and suggest new ones, that she/he had already visited.

That full stack app is my 100h projects, that I put blood sweat and tears into, 
I am really proud of it, and excited to deploy as soon as the interface is fully functional.
Nature and camping is something I started to get into a few months ago, usually used to the urban environments, cities and all the comfortable accommodations that it offers,
 I let you imagine my first experience in the woods, plus the time of adjustment required for me to feel comfortable and be able to sleep without fearing that a wolf or a bear would tear the tent down during the night.
Mother Nature possesses that silent and appeasing power to get you connected on several levels within yourself and the beautiful surroundings. That atmosphere is no near comparable than other habitats :
  in the woods, mountains, natural parks all of these wildlife  (barely)  untouched, instill a sense of responsibility, to protect what we have left, to respect the flora and fauna, 
  preserve these remaining areas and to comprehend how each eco system functions.

I hope that web application will encourage to a certain degree, people to book a tent in a campsite and experiment the wildlife for a few days, and sense how sacred our planet is.
