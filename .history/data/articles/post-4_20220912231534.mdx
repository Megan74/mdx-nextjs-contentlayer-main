## Yelpcamp app

I am currently building a camping sites suggestion app, for nature lovers.
 That heartfelt project contains a MERN stack, that integrates frontend and backend modules, plus the bootstrap library for the designing features.

The user will be able to chose among the most recommmended campsites, based upond the prices and locations. 
After being authentified, the user has the possibility to update the campground list, 
to delete or to suggest new ones. And the user has also the ability to rate the existing campgrounds, that she/he had already visited.

The following technologies and packages that I installed to make the project effective and functional are:

- Helmet & Dotenv : For the application security in the server.
- Passport, Joi, ExpressError & ExpressAsync middlewares : For the user authentication in the browser.
- Cloudinary & Mongodb : To store the user’s data and the pictures in the Model section indefinitely. 
- Mapbox & Bootstrap : To display in the frontend a pleasant design/graphic to the View (user's side)

With these multiple technologies implemented in my application, a practical architecture is required to identify correctly the potential bugs, and also to maintain in the long-term, a readable codebase.
The MVC paradigm is my foremost choice for that exact purpose.

 Here is how the Yelpcamp app is organized:

 •The Routes folder is divided into 3 sections: the Campground, the Users and the Reviews files. Its role is to redirect every frontend request to the adequate controller, by identifying the URL compositions: main route / , /campgrounds, /users, or  /review. By scanning through the request, the route will then redirect the URL to the corresponding controller, so it can execute the according actions required by the user in the browser.

 •The Controllers folder is also divided into the 3 same sections, so the Routes can transmit the request to the one that matches. Indeed, after the request has been redirected to one of these 3 controllers, via the route filter, the appropriate controller will then execute the specific action requested by the browser. 
 If the browser sends a **GET** request: the controllers' role (campground controller, user controller, or review controller), is to render a specific page, that is placed in the View, to the frontend. 
 If it is a **PUT** request: via the edit button, that specific request will connect with the Model folder, to connect the server with the database, then will fetch the corresponding id (data id chosen from the browser to modify the information), and change any data the user wants to update, it can be the campground's price or the campground’s rating via the review page. After updating the database with the modified info, the update controller will refresh the page with the modified information to the browser. 
If **POST** request: the application Routes that redirect that specific request to the corresponding controller's name (user, campground or review), will also connect the server to the model data structure, so it can add the new data sent from the browser via a form, to the server. A post request can be a brand new campground, a brand new review, or a new user added to the database and then the frontend. After the controller adds that required data, it will execute a refreshing action to render the page with the new information.
If **DELETE** request: as per the update request, the deleting action via its eponym button, will activate the model section so it can retrieve via the id data invoked, the corresponding collection/object name, and erase that required data via its ID. A refreshing action will then follow, and render a new page with the subtracted info.

 •The Model folder contains different sections matching with the application pages : User, Campground and Review. The Model is summoned upon by the controllers, so it operates through the mongoose database, by retrieving, adding, updating or deleting specific data via its ID. And then be re rendered to the browser. The manipulated data is defined by the Schema model, a Mongodb functionality. That object like protoype, structures the database with flexibility, and inform which element will be displayed into the Mongo collections.

 • The View folder : that folder is displayed to the user, via the ejs template that is used to plug the data. Every pages from the project are placed into that section. The View is only connected to the Controller and has no relation with the Model, no matter the request activated.

## The code architecture 
 ```js index.js box=1[30:50]
.cloudinary : pictures remote handler

.controllers : programming handler that executes specific actions when request recieved to the server.

.models : Mongodb data structure with personified design schemas

.public : layout design CSS, geolocalisation functionalities rendered to the clientside

.routes : direct the requests to the corresponding controller

.seeds : data template

.utils : handling errors and asynchronous requests

.views : graphic frontend

**app.js : main root**

middleware.js 

schemas.js : input validations
```

That full stack app is my 100h(and plus plus) projects. I have put blood sweat and tears into it, and
I am really proud and excited, to have been able to fully develop, produce and deploy that application.

Nature and camping are themes that I am truely interested in. Mother Nature possesses that silent and appeasing power, to get you connected on several levels within yourself, and your mesmerizing surroundings. 
That unique atmosphere is no near comparable than other habitats :
 the woods, the mountains, natural parks, all of these wildlife  (barely) untouched by the human existence areas, instill a sense of responsibility to protect what is left, to respect the flora and fauna, 
  to preserve these remaining and fragile eco-systems, and to comprehend how each of them function.

I hope that web application will encourage to a certain degree, people to book a tent once in a campsite, to disconnect from the daily routine, to experiment the wildlife for a few days, to sense how sacred our Planet is.
