My life  has always been a synonym of adventures and risk-taking decisions, that is obviously natural to me,
to pursue a career that is a galaxy away from the profesional path I have been to for years.

I purposely attach the tech industry with astronomical terms, because the first thing I noticed, when I started my journey as a web developer is the tremendous ocean of tools, programming languages, modules, libraries, sectors, opportunities and all the core technologies that are built on the daily basis. Internet has been invented only 40 years ago, and yet it is mindblowing, how it revolutionized on deep levels and layers how way-of-living.
Our lives has just drastically improved, the accessibility and fastness to get informations, direct contacts with people accross the world, to collect essential data, to be in the heart of historical events through social medias. All this new ways of communication and information acess, are mainly the reasons why I am now willing to become a software engineer.

I too, would like to create, and contribute to that important mission, to connect people across the globe with social platforms, and advanced technologic tools.

I actually always being passionate about creative industries, fashion is among one for example. So linking my love with the fashion universe and my web developer skillset, would be a big project that I would love to get on with. Though, during the pandemic and endless lockdowns, my idea was to create and design a clothing line for women, drawing my own line and buying the fabrics of my own choosing and then sew them together, that ambitious project, faced few blocks along the way. Indeed, the fashion industry offers multiple opportunities: on the production level, it is easy to draw, design, create during the early phases of creations, contact international and reliable supplier to invest in specific fabrics etc; but the real challenge though is else where, your line after being created sewed and came into life, has to be recognized and known by your customer target and fashion peers. So the key here is to get the right connexions and have some marketing knowledge, to put your clothing line into the spotlight.
  
Drawing a clothing line, creating and produce the clothes myself, would have been also a huge amount of time and energy spent, plus a lot of money to invest in without being sure it'll be a successful and frutuous project. The reality is, without any connexions with high profile professionals in the industry, the right adress book, and only having to bet on myself, on my vision and skillset, would have been a huge risk to take, so I sadly gave up, or let's say press a pause button on that dream project of mine. 

Today, I chose to become a software engineer, and this time I do not feel like it is out of reach. I actually feel like it is connecting the missing dots in my professional life. My creative mind never has been fulfilled professionnally speaking. Creating multiple projects, coding them through life, integrating several packages, modules to add architectural layers to the work, and deploy the final result live for users across the globe, is incredibly satisfying, and very parallel to my previous journey as a fresh fashion designer. Having an adress book filled with Mark Zuckerberg contact details, or having a social media platform with millions of followers to connect your creation to most of your clientele, is not a requirement to succeed in that field. That time, it is actually about your technical skills and proficiency, indeed, having to prove how good you are at programming by showing your codebase, projects, train of thoughts and developer logic, and demonstrate how passionate you are doing it, illustrates how exciting and unrestricted that career path is.
