## Les vacances

My blog is also about my hobbies and what I love doing, travelling is obviously a big component of my lifestyle.

My career trajectory is so atypical, I first worked as a flight attendant and that unique experience, reinforced my open-mnidness and my will to explore and enjoy life to its fullest. Travelling all around the world in a short lapse of time, is such a privilege. Never in a lifetime I would have guessed that I would travel in Hong Kong 5 times within a month just by requesting the destination.

I am fully greatful and know the chance I had. Now today, I still possess that will to travel in unique and awesome places, and that year I chose to go to Miami. And let me tell you, that trip was just as I imagined: grandiose, epic, marvellous.

I always had that eager to travel to the United States, being raised with the american soft power since little girl, played a huge part for my love for that country. The movies, the tv shows, music, art, even food (French readers forgive me ahah), I mean they have it all culturally, I am fond of their lifestyle.

I also notice how nice, relaxed they are, that was quite mind blowing. As I live in a country where everything is going 1555 miles / hour, and everyone can be easily stressed, here in Florida they take the time to enjoy life.

You can also notice that time is an interesting component there. The building architectures in Ocean drive, are full of flashy colours lightened with 60s' neons, and old school designs. It just feels like time has frozen there, and Elvis may park his Cadillac and show up at any minute, or the Miami Vice cops would spectacularly chase some
coke dealers in their 70s fashionnable suit, through Indian Creek street at sunset.

Miami is just the vacay spot by excellence, all the recipies are gathered: the sunny weather, the people roller skating at the beach, the millions of palms at every corner, the carribean inspired food, art and special architecture in the streets, cuban barrios. People actually are helpful, cordial, willing to party at any moment (got stopped in the street billions of time by locals, asking me where I'm heading), they also get the time to go to the beach, to have little run at sunrise, to exercise at the ocean drive bay, with music blasting at 4444 decibels. They are making the time for things that actually matter: selfcare, taking care of their mental and physical health. A mantra I took with me along all the amazing memories created, while getting back home.
