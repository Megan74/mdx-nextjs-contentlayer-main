## Model View Controller

Engineering websites and applications require certain patterns and  paradigm to follow, so the codebase stay organized readable, easily debugged, and perfectly maintained.
The separation of concerns is applied on the frontend, the visible section by the user, and it can also be used in the backend, where the server and all the process going under the hood.
The MVC pattern which is located in the backend server, has that specific purpose. It enables the code to be split into diverse folders that has different missions.
That paradigm invented in 1978 by the Norwegian computer engineer Trygve Reenskaug, was specifically created to encapsulate and abstract codes into three different folders that intereact with each other:

-Model : the model contains all the information, data, pictures stored into relational database structures such as SQL or non-relational object oriented databases such as Mongodb.

-Views: will show the data retrieved by Model into the clientside, that is the visible part of the pattern. Views is directly connected with the controllers.

-Controllers : are the middleman, the most important piece of the programming process. The browser sending a request to the server will be received by different backend layers :

         •The Router: the router functionality is to listen to the URL client-side request, so it can identify which CRUD req is sent, so it can redirect it to the adequate controller

         •The Controller: which is also a MVC backend programming component, receives the req from the router, and matches it with the adequate router, that will execute the requested action sent by the browser, create/poste, read/get, update/put, delete.
      Note: According to the nature of the req, the controller can either directly execute an action to view (ex: refresh a page), either go through models to collect/retrieve required data.

These three patterns help organize and visualize how the project codebase works underneath the hood, to have a better understanding of each functionalities and their missions. The Model is a sort of bucket connecting the server with a database that store all information data needed for further requests, mongodb is my favorite non-relational database. 
Its specificity is that, it assemble data into collections of document, that are array of objects prototype. The models folder regroup these specific files that will be rendered to front end templates (ejs, react, hug), so views can shw them in the front end. Controller connect the right req with the right controller so the actions requested can be executed and the browser can receive the  according response.
